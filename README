Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is a Git submission for 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course project. 
It has the instructions on how to run_analysis.R script on Human Activity recognition
dataset.

Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files
1. Codebook.Rmd
This is an R Markdown file (you can open it in RStudio or any text editor) that describes
the variables, the data, and all transformations or work that was performed to clean up
the data.

2. run_analysis.R
This is the R script that does data preparation as needed and creates the output file
(Final_Tidy_Data.txt) containing the tidy data set. The main functions of this script 
are listed below:
    * Downloads the zip file containing raw input data set 
    * Merges the training and the test data sets to create one data set.
    * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
    * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
    * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the
      average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    * Creates output file Final_Tidy_Data.txt with the final tidy data set
To run: you can simply open this script in RStudio and source it or run in line-by-line

3. Final_Tidy_Data.txt
This is the output file created by the run_analysis.R script containing the final, tidy
data set.
To open: You can open this file in any text editor
To load: You can load this file in RStudio using these commands:
    * Download the file to a local folder
    * tidy_data <- read.table("<path_to_the_folder>/Final_Tidy_Data.txt")
    * head(tidy_data) to print first 6 rows
    * str(tidy_data) to print the structure of tidy_data data frame
    * tidy_data to print entire data frame
